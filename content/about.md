# About Me

I'm a Staff Engineer at [IonQ](https://ionq.com/) working on the design of ion trap quantum computers.
Previously, I worked at [Microsoft Quantum](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/quantum-computing) where I worked on the design and simulation of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems for topological quantum computing. My driving passion is the development of predictive, realistic, and useful models that enable computer-aided design of highly non-linear experimental systems. In other words, if it can't be made in a lab to be tested, I'm not interested.

I have a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I did theoretical and computational condensed matter physics. Prior to that, I got my B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of Southern California.
