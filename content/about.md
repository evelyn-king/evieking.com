# About Me

Hello there! My name is Evelyn and my pronouns are she/they.

I am a physicist, engineer, and software developer who's spent the last decade on the design and simulation of quantum computing hardware. In other words, I design qubits ðŸ˜ƒ.

Currently, I am a Staff Engineer at [IonQ](https://ionq.com/) where I work on writing simulation tools that streamline and simplify modeling the behavior of ion traps. Previously, I worked at [Microsoft Quantum](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/quantum-computing) where I worked on the simulation of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems for topological quantum computing. Before that, during my graduate studies, I worked in semiconductor spin-based qubits.

I have a Ph.D. from the University of Wisconsin-Madison where I did theoretical and computational condensed matter physics with Susan Coppersmith as my advisor. Prior to that, I got my B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of Southern California.
