Hello there! My name is Evelyn and my pronouns are she/they.
I am a physicist, engineer, and software developer who&rsquo;s spent the last decade on the design and simulation of quantum computing hardware. In other words, I design qubits ðŸ˜ƒ.
Currently, I am a Staff Engineer at IonQ where I work on writing simulation tools that streamline and simplify modeling the behavior of ion traps. Previously, I worked at Microsoft Quantum where I worked on the simulation of hybrid superconductor-semiconductor systems for topological quantum computing. Before that, during my graduate studies, I worked in semiconductor spin-based qubits.">
